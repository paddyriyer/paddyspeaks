And still no real trust.</p><p>That’s not a platform. That’s noise at industrial scale</p><hr><p><strong>LinkedIn’s Core Model Is Dead</strong></p><p>LinkedIn still runs on the most naive assumption in the modern internet:</p><blockquote><p><strong>People will tell the truth about themselves.</strong></p></blockquote><p>That assumption was shaky even in 2015.</p><p>In the AI era, it’s laughable.</p><p>Today, anyone can generate in minutes:</p><ul><li><p>a resume that looks like a Stanford graduate wrote it</p></li><li><p>a portfolio with “case studies” that never happened</p></li><li><p>a job history full of fake companies</p></li><li><p>certifications copied from templates</p></li><li><p>30 posts a month written by an LLM</p></li><li><p>even recommendation letters that sound emotional and “authentic”</p></li></ul><p>So what exactly is LinkedIn ranking?</p><p>Truth?

Here's what we're building. </p><p><strong>Here is the Product Requirements Document</strong></p><h2>1. Executive Summary</h2><p>LinkedIn served its purpose beautifully in the pre-AI era. But in today’s world it’s rapidly turning into a noisy museum of outdated hiring logic. Fake profiles multiply overnight, spam recruiters flood DMs, ghost jobs waste millions of hours, and AI-generated content makes every feed indistinguishable from noise. The professional network of the 2030s cannot be a vanity platform. It must be a trust-first, human-centric career survival system.</p><p>ProveIt v3.0 is that system. It is built around five foundational domains: Trust &amp; Identity, Proof-of-Work Profiles, Hiring Transparency, Employer Accountability, and Career Survival &amp; Wellbeing. Every feature is designed to answer one question: does this help a real human navigate their career with dignity, clarity, and support?</p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQEvC9mUqf-Kgg" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEvC9mUqf-Kgg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/B56ZxjvZT9HEAU-/0/1771199895216?e=1773878400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=a5jn7ACOfKt1D1ueYvPoZP3-_5wF3MnmO8ipZv_3fr8"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>2. The Problem: LinkedIn in the AI Age</h2><p>LinkedIn was designed for a world where humans wrote their own profiles, recruiters personally reviewed candidates, and job postings represented real positions. That world no longer exists. In the AI age:</p><ul><li><p>Fake profiles scale instantly with generative AI — one bad actor can create thousands</p></li><li><p>Fake recruiters use AI to craft convincing but fraudulent outreach at volume</p></li><li><p>Ghost jobs (30-40% of postings) harvest resumes with no intent to hire</p></li><li><p>AI-generated content floods feeds, making authentic expertise invisible</p></li><li><p>3-4 spam DMs per week is the new normal for any professional</p></li><li><p>Keyword-based ATS rejects qualified candidates over formatting</p></li><li><p>Employers ghost with zero consequence, repost the same role 12 times</p></li><li><p>No wellbeing support while the platform profits from career anxiety</p></li><li><p>Jobs are getting scarcer as AI automates — no skill-to-income bridge exists</p></li><li><p>40%+ of connections are inactive, bots, or duplicates — networks are hollow</p></li></ul><p><em>The professional network of the 2030s must be an immune system against these threats, not a breeding ground for them.</em></p><hr><h2>3.
