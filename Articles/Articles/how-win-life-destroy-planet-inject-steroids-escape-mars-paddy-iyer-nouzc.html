  <div><p>Welcome to the <strong>21st century</strong>, where success is not measured by wisdom, kindness, or integrity, but by <strong>how many people you can outsmart, how much wealth you can hoard, and how ruthlessly you can dominate.</strong></p><p>Forget selflessness, cooperation, or serving a higher purpose—those are concepts for the weak, right? Today, the real heroes are the ones who <strong>conquer Everest, patent the air we breathe, inject performance-enhancing drugs to win races, pollute the Earth, and then plan to escape to Mars.</strong></p><p>If you ever wondered what happens when <strong>jealousy, greed, and over-competition</strong> become the core principles of human civilization, <strong>just look around!</strong> We turned the world into a giant reality show where everyone is out to <strong>"crush the competition,"</strong> and then cry about stress, anxiety, and climate change.</p><p>And when someone dares suggest that life is about <strong>cooperation and selflessness</strong>, we roll our eyes and say, <em>“</em><strong><em>Yeah, right. Tell that to Wall Street, sports doping agencies, or the guy next door who stole my business idea and patented it</em></strong><em>.”</em></p><p>But long before humans started this genius plan of <strong>destroying their only habitable planet</strong>, our scriptures had already provided <strong>the real formula for sustainable success.</strong></p><hr><h2>Bhagavad Gita 3.11: The Forgotten Law of Reciprocity</h2><p><strong>"Devan bhāvayatānena te devā bhāvayantu vah, Parasparam bhāvayantaḥ śreyaḥ param avāpsyatha."</strong></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> <em>"By nourishing the devas (natural forces), they will nourish you in return. By sustaining each other, you will attain the supreme good."</em></p><p>Bhagavan Krishna <strong>wasn’t talking about bribing gods to get special favors.</strong> The <em>devas</em> in this verse symbolize the <strong>forces of nature</strong>—Indra (rain), Agni (fire), Varuna (water), and Prajapati (creation).</p><p>In simple terms: <strong>If you take care of nature, nature takes care of you.</strong></p><p>But modern intelligence says otherwise:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Why take care of the rainforests? Just build more air conditioners!</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Why respect water bodies? Just invest in a water purification startup!</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Why live in harmony with Earth when Elon Musk will take us to Mars? 😱😆🤑</strong></p></li></ul><p>Who cares about balancing the ecosystem when we can just <strong>invent solutions after breaking everything?</strong></p><p>The irony is <strong>Bhagavan Krishna literally warned us</strong> about this thousands of years ago, but instead of following his advice, we decided that polluting the Earth and finding a backup planet was <strong>"innovation."</strong></p><hr><h3>The Subhashitam That Nature Would Post If It Had Social Media</h3><p>If nature could write a resignation letter, it would include this Sanskrit verse:</p><p><strong>परोपकाराय फलन्ति वृक्षाः, परोपकाराय वहन्ति नद्यः। परोपकाराय दुहन्ति गावः, परोपकारार्थमिदं शरीरम्॥</strong></p><p><strong>(Paropakārāya Phalanti Vṛkṣāḥ, Paropakārāya Vahanti Nadyaḥ, Paropakārāya Duhanti Gāvāḥ, Paropakārārtham Idaṁ Śarīram.)</strong></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> <em>"Trees bear fruit for the benefit of others, rivers flow selflessly to nourish the world, cows yield milk for others, and the human body is meant for selfless service."</em></p><p>This Subhashitam <strong>makes the modern world deeply uncomfortable</strong> because it directly contradicts our <strong>"me-first" culture.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Trees</strong> don’t trademark their oxygen and charge royalties for every breath we take.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rivers</strong> don’t refuse to flow unless you subscribe to their premium service.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cows</strong> don’t withhold milk until you sign a contract.</p></li><li><p><strong>And yet, humans?</strong> We patent <strong>medicines, ideas, even yoga postures!</strong></p></li></ul><h3>The Way Nature Works vs. The Way Humans Operate</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Trees (Vṛkṣāḥ) bear fruits selflessly</strong> – A tree never eats its own fruits but provides shade, oxygen, and sustenance for all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rivers (Nadyaḥ) flow for others</strong> – A river does not drink its own water but nourishes life wherever it flows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cows (Gāvāḥ) provide milk selflessly</strong> – The cow symbolizes motherhood and nourishment, giving without asking in return.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Human Body (Idam Śarīram) is meant for selfless service</strong> – Our existence should be dedicated to uplifting others.</p></li></ul><p>It’s almost as if <strong>nature is trying to teach us something, but we’re too busy trying to trademark kindness and bottle fresh air for sale.</strong></p><p>Forget selflessness—<strong>we’ve turned everything into intellectual property.</strong> Soon, someone might patent <strong>"fresh air"</strong> and charge a monthly subscription fee.</p><p>We have successfully moved from <strong>"serving others"</strong> to <strong>"exploiting others for profit."</strong></p><hr><h3>The Modern Obsession: Jealousy, Competition, and Fake Success</h3><p>If you’re not competing, are you even living? That’s the question today’s world asks. Cooperation is seen as <strong>a weakness</strong>, and extreme competition is branded as <strong>ambition.</strong></p><h3>1. Performance-Enhancing Drugs: Because Cheating is Faster Than Hard Work</h3><p>Why train for years when you can <strong>inject some artificial "talent" and call yourself a champion?</strong> We’ve built a world where <strong>ethics are optional, but winning is compulsory.</strong></p><p>Bhagavan Krishna said <strong>work hard and stay detached from the results</strong>, but the modern athlete says <strong>inject steroids and buy a good lawyer in case you get caught. </strong></p><h3>2. Conquering Everest: Because Nature Must Be Defeated</h3><p>Everest is <strong>not a mountain anymore—it’s a status symbol.</strong> People risk their lives to reach the top, not to understand nature’s magnificence, but to <strong>take a selfie and prove their superiority.</strong></p><p>Meanwhile, the mountain, covered in garbage and dead bodies of failed climbers, silently wonders: <em>"Did I ask to be conquered?"</em></p><h3>3. Destroying Earth and Calling it Progress</h3><p>We burn fossil fuels, pollute the oceans, and cut down forests at record speed. Then we sit in air-conditioned rooms, sipping plastic-bottled water, and <strong>complain about climate change.</strong></p><p>The solution? <strong>Escape to Mars!</strong></p><ul><li><p>First, we break Earth.</p></li><li><p>Then, we spend <strong>billions</strong> figuring out how to survive in a lifeless desert.</p></li></ul><h2>Genius, isn’t it? 🤡</h2><p>Bhagavad Gita 3.11 says, <strong>"Live in harmony with nature, and it will sustain you."</strong> The modern world says, <strong>"Destroy nature, then invent new technology to fix it!"</strong></p><hr><h3>The Alternative: Living by Karma Yoga Instead of Selfishness</h3><p>We do not need <strong>Mars colonies, performance drugs, or Everest selfies</strong> to prove our worth. Bhagavan Krishna already gave us a <strong>simple and effective way to live well</strong>:</p><h3>1. Shift from Competition to Cooperation</h3><ul><li><p>Instead of asking, <em>"How can I beat others?"</em> ask <em>"How can we grow together?"</em></p></li><li><p>Success is <strong>not a limited resource</strong>—helping others doesn’t take anything away from you.</p></li></ul><h3>2. Stop Taking More Than You Give</h3><ul><li><p><em>Like trees, rivers, and cows, contribute more than you consume.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of finding loopholes to avoid taxes, try <strong>giving back to society.</strong></p></li></ul><h3>3. Respect Nature Instead of Exploiting It</h3><ul><li><p>If you take from the earth, <strong>give something back.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of throwing plastic into rivers, try <strong>not throwing plastic into rivers.</strong></p></li></ul><h3>4. Be Grateful Instead of Always Wanting More</h3><ul><li><p>We spend <strong>our whole lives chasing more,</strong> never realizing that <strong>enough was always enough.</strong></p></li><li><p>Bhagavan Krishna taught <strong>detachment from results,</strong> but modern humans are <strong>never satisfied with anything.</strong></p></li></ul><h3>5. Serve Others as a Spiritual Duty</h3><ul><li><p>The human body exists <strong>not just for survival, but for contribution.</strong></p></li><li><p>Helping others is <strong>not a side activity—it is the reason we exist.</strong></p></li></ul><hr><h3>Dharma Rakshati Rakshitah: Protect Dharma, and Dharma Protects You</h3><p>There’s a simple Sanskrit phrase that should be <strong>tattooed onto modern civilization’s forehead:</strong></p><p><strong>धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः</strong> <em>(Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitah)</em></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> <em>"Dharma protects those who protect it."</em></p><p>But here’s the twist—<strong>Dharma doesn’t protect those who only invoke it when convenient.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Karna learned this the hard way in the Mahabharata.</strong> He ignored Dharma when it suited him, but when his chariot got stuck, he suddenly remembered the rules.</p></li><li><p>Krishna had to remind him that <strong>selective morality is not morality at all.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Dharma isn’t some magical force that steps in <strong>only when it benefits you</strong>. It works <strong>only when you uphold it consistently</strong>—not when you cheat, steal, and exploit, and then expect divine intervention to clean up the mess.</p><hr><h3>Final Thoughts: The Choice is Ours</h3><p>We live in an era where people think <strong>outsmarting others, extracting more, and working less</strong> is the ultimate goal. But this thinking is <strong>deeply flawed.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>True success</strong> is not about winning but about <strong>making life better for others.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>True happiness</strong> comes not from competing but from <strong>cooperating.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Bhagavad Gita 3.11 and the <strong>Subhashitam on selflessness</strong> remind us:</p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQHGy493zy-L0g" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHGy493zy-L0g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/B56ZW1mjh_HEAY-/0/1742508543615?e=1773273600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=pX1IINrI-PFZVu3PpAj4tcZQw-IkdD91Be35S-zDRYA"><figcaption><strong>Give to nature, and nature will sustain you</strong></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQF6Qq6ENvBV3A" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQF6Qq6ENvBV3A/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/B56ZW1msWXHEAc-/0/1742508581644?e=1773273600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=KnNGOagibLZ9OKnl5qghIERh8dmJF8kmvtu-vtwgIp8"><figcaption><strong>Serve others, and the world will support you.</strong></figcaption></figure><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D5612AQGKK2VsYKPc3w" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGKK2VsYKPc3w/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/B56ZW1m1sMGsAU-/0/1742508617911?e=1773273600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=TEBISzZOKA_SeoQ_Ksqd2QxsfU6j4on0a__X8kWj7JY"><figcaption><strong>Live with Dharma, and Dharma will protect you.</strong></figcaption></figure><p></p><p>Or, of course, you can keep believing that <strong>injecting steroids, climbing Everest, and escaping to Mars</strong> are the highest achievements of human civilization.</p><p>The choice is yours. 🌿✨</p></div>
