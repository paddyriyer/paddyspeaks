<div class="article-content">

            <p class="drop-cap">The Ramayana whispers a timeless truth: <strong>even God, when walking as man, does not walk alone.</strong></p><p>Rama, though Vishnu Himself with all his divine powers, <strong>still needed the hands, hearts, and courage of humans, monkeys, and every living being to find Sita.</strong> Not because he was weak. Not because his powers were insufficient. But because greatness itself demands connection.</p><p>Think about that for a moment. The Supreme Being, capable of destroying armies with a single arrow, chose to build a bridge stone by stone with an army of monkeys. He could have flown across the ocean. Instead, he waited while every creature—from the mightiest bear to the smallest squirrel—brought their contribution.</p><p><strong>The scene is worth painting clearly:</strong> Hanuman could leap across oceans. Jambavan, the ancient bear king, brought wisdom from ages past. Vibhishana, Ravana&#x27;s own brother, risked everything to defect and share enemy secrets. Sugriva commanded monkey armies. Angada negotiated. And yes, a tiny squirrel—mocked by larger animals—brought pebbles in its mouth, wetting them in the ocean to make them stick.</p><p>When the monkeys laughed at the squirrel&#x27;s meager contribution, Rama stopped them. He gently picked up the creature, stroked its back with three fingers, and blessed it. <em>&quot;Every contribution matters,&quot;</em> he said. <em>&quot;This squirrel has given everything it has.&quot;</em></p><p>Those three stripes remain on every squirrel&#x27;s back to this day in Indian tradition—a reminder that no contribution is too small when given wholeheartedly.</p><p><strong>Power without connection is hollow. Greatness without support is unfinished.</strong></p><hr><h3>The Two Philosophies: A Tale of Two Worlds</h3><p><strong>The West seeks space.</strong> Stand on your own. Make your own way. Independence is the highest virtue. &quot;Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.&quot; The self-made man. The lone genius. The individual triumphing against all odds.</p><p>Think of Western mythology: <strong>Superman,</strong> alone in his fortress of solitude. <strong>Batman, </strong>the solitary dark knight. <strong>Odysseus,</strong> clever and self-reliant, conquering challenges through his own cunning. Even our business heroes are framed this way—the lone founder in a garage, the visionary who saw what others couldn&#x27;t.</p><p><strong>India seeks bonds.</strong> You are part of a web. Your strength comes through connection. Interdependence is the highest wisdom. Even the gods need devotees. Even the king needs his subjects. Even the warrior needs his brother.</p><p>Krishna doesn&#x27;t fight the Mahabharata war—he drives Arjuna&#x27;s chariot and counsels him. Rama doesn&#x27;t conquer alone—he builds alliances across species. Shiva&#x27;s power is complete only with Shakti. Even in divinity, completion comes through union, not isolation.</p><p><strong>Neither philosophy is wrong. Both carry profound truth. </strong>But when <em>we worship independence so completely that we forget interdependence, we lose something essential about how humans actually thrive.</em></p><hr><h3>The Modern Illusion: Airbrushing Out the Army</h3><p>We live in an age that celebrates the solo founder, the individual contributor, the &quot;I did it myself&quot; narrative. LinkedIn itself is built on stories of personal triumph, individual achievement, singular vision.</p><p>But scratch beneath any success story and you&#x27;ll find an entire ecosystem of support.</p><p><strong>Steve Jobs</strong> at <a>Apple</a> had Steve Wozniak building the technology, Jony Ive designing the products, and thousands of engineers, designers, and believers executing the vision. Jobs was brilliant—but he was brilliant at orchestrating an army, not building alone.</p><p><strong>Einstein</strong> had a community of physicists—Bohr, Heisenberg, Planck—challenging and refining his ideas. He had his first wife, Mileva Marić, a physicist herself, discussing theories with him during the miraculous year of 1905. He had patent office colleagues who debated ideas during lunch breaks.</p><p><strong>Every &quot;self-made&quot; billionaire</strong> had mentors who saw potential, partners who shared risk, employees who built alongside them, investors who believed when others doubted, and yes—timing and luck in the form of people who showed up when needed most.</p><p>Yet we airbrush out the army. We frame the story as lone genius because it&#x27;s cleaner, more inspiring, more marketable.</p><p><strong>The Ramayana refuses to do this.</strong> It names every ally. It honors every contribution. It builds monuments to the bridge-builders.</p><hr><h3>When Adversity Strikes: The Real Test</h3><p>The test comes not in calm waters but in storms.</p><p><strong>When Lakshmana fell in battle</strong>, poisoned by Indrajit&#x27;s serpent arrow, even Rama—the avatar of Vishnu—felt helpless. He could have healed his brother with divine touch. But he didn&#x27;t. Why?</p><p>Because the story needed <strong>Hanuman.</strong></p><p>Rama turned to him and said: <em>&quot;Fly to the Himalayas. Bring me the Sanjeevani herb before dawn, or my brother dies.&quot;</em></p><p>Hanuman flew across the subcontinent. But when he reached the mountain of herbs, he faced a problem: he couldn&#x27;t identify which plant was Sanjeevani. Every herb looked similar in the dark. Time was running out. Lakshmana was dying.</p><p>So Hanuman made a choice that reveals everything: <strong>He lifted the entire mountain</strong> and flew it back to Lanka.</p><p><em>&quot;If I cannot identify the right medicine, I will bring all the medicines.&quot;</em></p><p>This is what true support looks like. Not perfect execution. Not knowing all the answers. But <strong>bringing everything you have when someone needs you.</strong></p><p><strong>When adversity strikes, it is not strength that saves us—it is togetherness.</strong></p><hr><h3>The Pandemic Proof</h3><p>The COVID-19 pandemic revealed this truth brutally and beautifully.</p><p>Those who weathered it best weren&#x27;t necessarily the strongest individuals. They were the people with strong networks, supportive communities, reliable connections.</p><p>The small business owner whose loyal customers bought gift cards to keep them afloat. The freelancer whose network rallied with referrals when work dried up. The family that leaned on each other rather than apart. The neighbors who left groceries on doorsteps. The colleagues who checked in, not just with &quot;How&#x27;s the project?&quot; but with &quot;How are <em>you</em>?&quot;</p><p>I watched companies survive because teams chose solidarity over self-preservation. I saw entrepreneurs make it because their community became their Hanuman—bringing the whole mountain when they couldn&#x27;t identify what single thing would save them.</p><p><strong>The illusion of independence crumbled.</strong> What emerged was the ancient truth: we are only as strong as the web we&#x27;re woven into.</p><hr><h3>The Sacred Choice: Why Rama Chose the Harder Path</h3><p>Here&#x27;s what the Ramayana really teaches, and it&#x27;s the most profound part:</p><p><strong>Rama chose interdependence.</strong></p><p>He didn&#x27;t <em>need</em> to. As Vishnu incarnate, he could have:</p><ul><li><p>Flown across the ocean himself</p></li><li><p>Destroyed Ravana with a thought</p></li><li><p>Retrieved Sita before Ravana knew what happened</p></li><li><p>Ended the story in a chapter</p></li></ul><p>But he chose to walk the human path. To build alliances. To accept help. To recognize the contribution of every being—down to the squirrel who brought pebbles for the bridge while others carried boulders.</p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>Because the victory wasn&#x27;t the point. <strong>The bonds formed in pursuit of victory were the point.</strong></p><p>The bridge to Lanka isn&#x27;t just infrastructure—it&#x27;s a metaphor for what we build when we work together toward something larger than ourselves. Every stone in that bridge represented trust. Every alliance represented courage. Every contribution represented belief in a shared purpose.</p><p>That choice made the victory meaningful. That choice made the story eternal. That choice made Rama not just a god, but a king worth following into exile, into war, into uncertainty.</p><hr><h3>The Corporate Ramayana: What This Means for Work</h3><p>Let&#x27;s bring this into the conference rooms and Slack channels where we spend our days.</p><p><strong>The Solo Founder Myth:</strong> We celebrate founders who &quot;did it alone.&quot; But talk to any successful entrepreneur and they&#x27;ll name their Hanumans—the early engineer who worked for equity, the advisor who made introductions, the partner who believed when everyone else doubted, the customers who took a chance on v1.</p><p><strong>The Individual Contributor Delusion:</strong> Organizations reward &quot;individual performance,&quot; but every high performer knows the truth: their success depends on colleagues who covered for them, managers who fought for their ideas, peers who collaborated generously, and yes—sometimes someone who lifted the whole mountain because time was running out.</p><p><strong>The &quot;No Weak Links&quot; Fallacy:</strong> Companies obsess over eliminating weak performers. But the Ramayana asks: <em>Weak by whose measure?</em> The squirrel couldn&#x27;t carry boulders. But its pebbles filled gaps the boulders couldn&#x27;t. Vibhishana wasn&#x27;t a fierce warrior. But his intelligence turned the tide. Every being had a role. Every contribution mattered.</p><p><strong>The Real Question:</strong> Are you building a team of superstar soloists, or are you building a bridge?</p><hr><h3>The Vulnerability Tax: Why We Resist</h3><p>If interdependence is so powerful, why do we resist it?</p><p>Because it requires vulnerability. And vulnerability feels dangerous.</p><p><strong><em>Asking for help means admitting you can&#x27;t do it alone.</em></strong> Accepting support means owing debt—social, emotional, professional. Building bonds means risking rejection, disappointment, betrayal.</p><p><strong>Independence is safer.</strong> If you fail alone, you only disappoint yourself. If you succeed alone, you owe no one. You&#x27;re in control. You&#x27;re protected.</p><p><strong>But you&#x27;re also limited.</strong></p><p>Rama risked his divine dignity by bowing to monkey kings. He risked betrayal by accepting Vibhishana, Ravana&#x27;s own brother, into his inner circle. His army doubted Vibhishana. <em>&quot;This is a trap,&quot;</em> they said. <em>&quot;He&#x27;s a spy.&quot;</em></p><p>Rama trusted anyway. Not blindly—he was wise enough to test. But he chose to trust because <strong>greatness requires the risk of trusting.</strong></p><p>That risk—that willingness to need others—is what made him not just a god, but a leader worth following into impossible battles.</p><hr><h3>The Worthy Risk: What Time Reveals</h3><p>Life, in the end, is shaped by the choices we dare to make, and time alone reveals which risks were worthy, which sacrifices sacred.</p><p><strong>The risk of asking for help.</strong> Time reveals whether your pride was worth more than progress.</p><p><strong>The sacrifice of credit for collaboration.</strong> Time reveals whether the shared victory was greater than the solo achievement.</p><p><strong>The vulnerability of admitting you cannot do it alone.</strong> Time reveals whether isolation was strength or just loneliness dressed in armor.</p><p>I&#x27;ve made both choices in my career. Times I&#x27;ve insisted on doing it myself, refusing help, protecting my autonomy. Times I&#x27;ve reached out, built teams, accepted support, shared credit.</p><p>Time has been clear in its verdict: <strong>Every meaningful thing I&#x27;ve built has been a bridge, not a monument.</strong></p><hr><h3>The Bridge We Build: A Closing Meditation</h3><p>So perhaps the question isn&#x27;t whether you&#x27;re strong enough to succeed alone.</p><p>Perhaps it&#x27;s whether you&#x27;re wise enough to succeed together.</p><p>Your bridge is waiting. Your allies are around you—though you may not recognize them yet. The Hanumans who will leap across oceans for you. The Vibhishanas who will risk everything to stand beside you. The Sugrivas who will command armies on your behalf. And yes, the squirrels who will bring pebbles with their whole heart.</p><p><strong>Your job isn&#x27;t to carry every boulder yourself.</strong></p><p>Your job is to recognize the contribution of every being. To make space for different strengths. To honor small offerings alongside large ones. To build something together that none of you could build alone.</p><p>Because even God, when walking as man, understood this fundamental truth:</p><p>The greatest power is not in standing alone.</p><p><strong>It&#x27;s in choosing not to.</strong></p><hr><h3>Three Questions for Reflection:</h3><ol><li><p>Who are the Hanumans in your life—the ones who lift mountains for you?</p></li><li><p>When did you last play the role of the squirrel—giving everything you had, even when it seemed small?</p></li><li><p>What bridge are you building, and who are you building it with?</p></li></ol><h3>The Ramayana isn&#x27;t asking you to be Rama.</h3><p>It&#x27;s asking you to recognize that Rama, with all his divine power, still needed an army of believers.</p><p>If even God needed help, what makes you think you don&#x27;t?</p><hr><p><em>What bridges are you building? Who are the Hanumans in your journey? I&#x27;d love to hear your stories of interdependence in the comments.</em></p>
