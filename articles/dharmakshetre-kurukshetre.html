            <p class="drop-cap">The modern software industry resembles the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where teams grapple with competing priorities, ethical dilemmas, and blind ambition. Bad product managers and technical program managers (TPMs) often act like Dhritarashtra — blind to the consequences of their actions but deeply attached to their products and processes. Developers, much like Arjuna, are often confused, caught between their ethical values and the demands of the business. Amidst this chaos, every team needs a Krishna — a guiding force to uphold dharma and steer the team toward responsible AI product development.</p>

                <p>Bad product managers and TPMs often push their teams to mimic competitors, ignoring their unique strengths or ethical considerations. These "Dhritarashtras" remain blind to the long-term consequences of their attachment to vanity metrics, focusing solely on hitting deadlines or maximizing revenue, even at the cost of user trust.</p>

                <p>The team must collectively identify its Krishna — a mentor, ethical leader, or even a framework of guiding principles — to realign the vision. Krishna ensures the team adheres to its <em>swadharma</em>, building products that align with their mission rather than chasing superficial goals.</p>

                <p>Consider a company designing an AI for mental health. Instead of adding clickbait features like gamification for user retention (<em>paradharma</em>), the team could focus on clinically validated tools for genuine emotional support (<em>swadharma</em>). This might result in slower growth initially but builds long-term trust and impact.</p>

                <p>Developers, much like Arjuna, often face decision paralysis. Should they optimize for performance metrics to appease their managers or build systems that prioritize user welfare?

                <p>Krishna's role here is to remind the team of their <em>nishkama karma</em> — to focus on doing the right thing (building fair and safe AI) without being consumed by the fruits of their labor (like market share or bonuses). A good Krishna could be an engineering leader who encourages ethical coding practices, or a governance body enforcing responsible AI frameworks.</p>

                <p>Krishna's wisdom lies in helping the team balance these energies. A Krishna-like leader could advocate for thoughtful innovation (<em>Sattva + Rajas</em>) while tempering rash decision-making (<em>Rajas</em>) and overcoming inertia (<em>Tamas</em>).</p>

            <!-- ═══ CONCLUSION ═══ -->
            <h2>Finding Your Krishna</h2>

            <p>Every tech team has its Kurukshetra — a chaotic environment with competing demands, ethical dilemmas, and blind ambitions. To wage a war against adharmic AI product development, teams must identify their Krishna — a mentor, principle, or framework that upholds dharma.</p>

            <p>By applying the lessons of the Bhagavad Gita, teams can overcome confusion, balance their energies, and build AI products that serve humanity rather than disrupt it. Let Krishna guide your Arjunas, curb the Dhritarashtras, and restore balance in the ever-evolving field of AI.</p>
